## Status
Karpet is currently in alpha

## About
Karpet is a open-source minestom server built for playing vanilla minecraft.

## 1.18 worlds
Currently there is many problems with loading 1.18 worlds in minestom, for now generating a 1.17 world and loading it will work,
you can still join from a 1.18 client.

## World generating
Karpet will not generate more terrain after the world is loaded. If you want to play with a bigger world try to load as much
as possible of it before you load it onto the server.
